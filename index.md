## :warning: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :warning:

![construction pikachu](assets/images/construction.gif)

## To-do list:

### "Day Zero"

- Migrate Jekyll site from GitHub to GitLab
    - \+ make site password-protected?

- Hide the *Marketers* audience for now; start with just *Developers* and *Technical Writers* to test things out (pilot audiences)

- THAT SAID: still need Marketing approval on certain rules that apply to *Developers* and *Technical Writers* (branding, terminology, etc.)

- Write a better homepage ("how to use this guide"...)

- Remove the "WIP" terminology from site title/flavor text

- Add HUMAN logo favicon

**GOAL:** "stealth" launch to test out a basic style guide; primarily focusing on technical documentation, but any brand-relevant rules have been signed off by Marketing 

### Down the road ("Day One")

- Expand list of HUMAN-specific rules accross all audiences

- Reintroduce the *Marketers* audience with Marketing-specific content (as provided by... Marketing)

- Add more audiences for Product Marketing, Visual Design, UX Design?

- Add resources (links to other style guides, templates, books, etc.)

- Create "minimum viable documentation" style checklist

- Try to add custom CSS for font style/link colors?

**GOAL:** official, companywide launch of a Real Style Guide; the actual content may not be "finished" in terms of scope/completion (since this is designed to be a flexible guide that grows with us), but everything that's in the guide is solid, fully approved, and we feel confident enforcing it. Has a minimum of three audiences on launch: *Developers*, *Marketers*, and *Technical Writers*. It would be great to have even more audiences than those three on Day One, but if time is a constraint, we can always add them afterwards.
