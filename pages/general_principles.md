## Three pillars
### Be concise.
Use simple, straightforward language that speaks directly to the reader. Don't use unnecessary technical jargon or excessive formality. 
Try to write sentences that flow naturally as if you were speaking out loud.

### Be clear.
Readers can read your words, but they can't read your mind. Each sentence should have a clear subject, a logical sense of cause and effect (press X button to receive Y result), and no grammatical ambiguity. When you start discussing a complex topic, try to provide a definition or other description context to help the reader understand what you mean and why the information is relevant to them. Don't assume all readers have the same knowledge or expertise.

### Be consistent.
When all else fails, make a choice and stick to it. Try to follow HUMAN's style guide as much as possibleâ€”but if the style guide is inaccessible or doesn't provide guidance about a certain topic, at least use language that's internally consistent within the same document.

## Questions to ask as you write:

* What is this document about?

* Why is this topic important?

* Who is our audience for this document?

* When would someone need to read this document?

* How would the reader use this information?
