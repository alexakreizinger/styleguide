  - rule: |
      ### Bots aren't always bad<br>
      Don't use the word *bot* to mean *bad bot*; if you're referring to a bad bot, use a descriptive adjective like *bad* or *malicious*. Similarly, if you're referring to a good or neutral bot, use a descriptive adjective like *benign* or *helpful*.

  - rule: |
      ### Hackers aren't always bad, either<br>
      Good hackers existâ€”many of them work for HUMAN! Don't use the word *hacker* to mean *bad hacker*; if you're referring to a bad hacker, use a descriptive adjective like *dangerous* or *malicious*. You can also use general terms like *fraudster*, *cybercriminal*, or *bad actor*. 
    audience: [tw, dev, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### *Signals* vs. *data*<br>
      The phrase *collect signals* is preferable to the phrase *collect data* (since the latter often has unfortunate implications).
    audience: [tw, dev, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Words to avoid<br>
      * Don't refer to hackers as *white hat* or *black hat*.
      * Don't use words like *blacklist* or *whitelist*; instead, say *deny list* or *allow list*.
