  - rule: |
      ### Product names<br>
      Our product offerings include **MediaGuard**, **FraudSensor**, **BotGuard for Growth Marketing**, **Botguard for Applications**, and **the HUMAN Mobile SDK**.
    audience: [tw, dev, mktg]

  - rule: |
      Don't abbreviate HUMAN's product names in public-facing documentation.<br>
    examples:

  - rule: |
      ### Internal vs. external names<br>
      Unless you're referring to a specific function or piece of code that includes an internal codename, always use external names in public-facing documentation.
    examples:
      - |
        Instead of Vesper, say **the Mitigation API**.
      - |
        Instead of Draco, say **the HUMAN Mobile SDK**.

      ### HUMAN doesn't block<br>
      HUMAN's products don't directly block traffic; we merely *analyze* traffic and return our recommendation for how the user should respond. It's up to our users to act on that recommendation.<br>

      As such, be careful not to imply that HUMAN's products block traffic (or take any kind of action at all). Instead, emphasize that we provide a recommendation, often in the form of an actionable data point, which users can then choose whether to incorporate into their own workflows.
    examples:
      - |
        **NO!!!:** The Mitigation API will block all events that were classified as bots.
      - |
        **Yes:** The Mitigation API will return a `block` response for all events that were classified as bots.

  - rule: |
      ### Bots aren't always bad<br>
      Don't use the word *bot* to mean *bad bot*; if you're referring to a bad bot, use a descriptive adjective like *bad* or *malicious*. Similarly, if you're referring to a good or neutral bot, use a descriptive adjective like *benign* or *helpful*.

  - rule: |
      ### Hackers aren't always bad, either<br>
      Good hackers existâ€”many of them work for HUMAN! Don't use the word *hacker* to mean *bad hacker*; if you're referring to a bad hacker, use a descriptive adjective like *dangerous* or *malicious*. You can also use general terms like *fraudster*, *cybercriminal*, or *bad actor*. 
    audience: [mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### *Signals* vs. *data*<br>
      The phrase *collect signals* is preferable to the phrase *collect data* (since the latter often has unfortunate implications).
    audience: [tw, dev, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Words to avoid<br>
      * Don't refer to hackers as *white hat* or *black hat*.
      * Don't use words like *blacklist* or *whitelist*; instead, say *deny list* or *allow list*.
