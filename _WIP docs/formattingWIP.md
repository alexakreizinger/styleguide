## Headings and titles

### Abbreviations in headings and titles<br>
It's okay to use abbreviations in headings and titles as long as you spell out the abbreviation in the subsequent paragraph.

For more information, see [Spelling out abbreviations]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.permalink}}grammar/spelling-out-abbreviations).

### Heading descriptions<br>
Make sure your headings never "touch"â€”every section of a document needs an introduction, so every heading should be followed by some kind of summary or description before the next subheading appears.

If one heading is immediately followed by another heading with no other text between them, your reader may be missing necessary context: what is this section for? Why is it important?

**Example:**
\#\# Mammals
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. They can live in water or on land.
\#\#\# Aquatic mammals
Aquatic mammals are mammals that live primarily or entirely in water, including whales, dolphins, seals, and manatees.

featured: All subheadings should be followed by a summary or description.

### Heading hierarchy<br>
Don't jump between heading levels. For example, an `h2` heading should not be immediately followed by an `h4` heading.
[tw, dev, mktg]

### Tasks in headings and titles<br>
If a heading or title describes a task, use an infinitive (a "plain" verb) instead of a gerundive (an *-ing* verb).
**No:** Installing Java
**Yes:** Install Java

## Lists

### Capitalizing list items<br>
Use sentence case for list items (including single-word items) unless the list item is case-sensitive or includes a `code` snippet.
[tw, dev, mktg]

### Introducing a list<br>
Most lists need an introductory sentence (or paragraph) before the first list item begins. This introduction can end with a period or with a colon.
[tw, dev, mktg]

### Ordered and unordered lists<br>
When the order of list items isn't important, use a bulleted (unordered) list.
**Example:**
A bicycle has three main components:
* Seat
* Handlebars
* Tires
[tw, dev, mktg]

When the order of list items is important, use a numbered (ordered) list. This usually appplies to sequences of steps or instructions. 
**Example:**
To bake a cake, follow these steps:
1. Mix the batter.
2. Bake in the oven.
3. Decorate to perfection.
[tw, dev, mktg]

However, if a procedure only has one step, use a bulleted (unordered) list instead.
**Example:** 
To turn on the light:
* Flip the light switch to the ON position.
[tw, dev]

When presenting a list of options to choose from, use a lettered (ordered) list.
**Example:**
You can choose one of the following colors:
A. Red
B. Yellow
C: Green
[tw, dev, mktg]

### Paired data<br>
For lists that include two pieces of data per list item (like a glossary term and its definition), use a bulleted (unordered) list. 

Format the first piece of data in **bold**, then use a colon to introduce the next piece of data.

**Example:**
The theme park offers three attractions.
* **Screamin' Mean Crazy Coaster:** A high-speed roller coaster. Not recommended for children.
* **Big Joe's River Adventure:** A log ride with water features. Suitable for all ages, but riders will get wet.
* **Schubert Express:** An interactive train tour. Perfect for young guests.

### Parallel structure<br>
Use parallel structure between items in the same list whenever possible. For example, you might start each list item with a verb or write each list item as a complete sentence.
[tw, dev, mktg]

### To list or not to list?<br>
If a list has fewer than three items, you might want to present the information in another format instead. 
[tw, dev, mktg]

## Numbers

### When to spell out numbers<br>
Spell out numbers zero through nine when they appear in a sentence, unless a numeral would be more appropriate (like for a version number, file size, or percentage).
**Example:** A bass guitar can have four, five, or six strings.
**Example:** Files should not exceed 8 MB in size.
[tw, dev, mktg]

However, if another numeral appears in the same sentence, use numerals consistently throughout.
**Example:** Of the dentists surveyed, only 1 in 100 recommended using chocolate frosting instead of toothpaste.
[tw, dev, mktg]

Use numerals for numbers 10 and higher.
**Example:** There were 14 penguins at the zoo.
[tw, dev, mktg]

If an ordinal number appears in a sentence (like *first*, *third*, or *twenty-ninth*), spell it out.
**Example:** The seventh page contains information about your warranty.
[tw, dev, mktg]

Spell out indefinite and nonspecific numbers.
**Example:** Millions of people suffer from seasonal allergies.
[tw, dev, mktg]

## Procedures and instructions

### Imperative verbs<br>
When possible, begin each step with an imperative verb. If a dependent clause precedes an independent clause, it's okay if the imperative verb isn't the first word in the sentence.
**Example:** Save your work before continuing.
**Example:** Choose any sword from the display case.
**Example:** To keep the park clean, pick up your trash when you leave.
[tw, dev]

### Introducing procedures<br>
Most procedural instructions need an introductory sentence (or paragraph) before the instruction begin. This introduction can end with a period or with a colon.
[tw, dev]

### Listing steps<br>
Use a numbered list to write out each step in a procedure. However, if a procedure only has one step, use a bulleted list instead.

For more information, see (Ordered and unordered lists)[{{site.baseurl}}{{page.permalink}}formatting-and-organization/#ordered-and-unordered-lists].
[tw, dev]

### Location<br>
If a step requires the reader to perform an action from a specific page, menu, or location, state the location before you describe the action.
**Example:** Using the **Country** drop-down menu, select the country you currently live in.
[tw, dev]

### One action per step<br>
Generally speaking, each step in a procedure should describe a single action.
[tw, dev]

However, sometimes it's helpful to combine several fast, closely related actions into a single step, especially to describe UI navigation. You can use angle brackets to describe the process of navigating multiple menu items in a row.
**Example:** Select **Filter > Distort > Liquify**.
[tw, dev]

### Outcomes<br>
If a step includes its intended outcome or goal, describe the outcome of the step before you describe the instructions to carry it out. (In other words, the dependent clause comes first.)
**No:** Select **New file** to create a new file.
**Yes:** To create a new file, select **New file**.
[tw, dev]

### Parallel structure<br>
Try to use parallel structure between different steps in the same procedure.
**Example:**
1. Open the door.
2. Put on your shoes.
3. Grab your keys.
4. Close and lock the door behind you.
[tw, dev]

## Tables

### Introducing a table<br>
Most tables need an introductory sentence (or paragraph) before the table begins. This introduction can end with a period or with a colon.
[tw, dev, mktg]

### Table or list?<br>
If a table only has two columns, you should probably format the information as a [list]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.permalink}}formatting-and-organization/#paired-data) instead.
