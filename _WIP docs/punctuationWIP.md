## Colons

### Colons and capitalization<br>
If you're using a colon within a self-contained sentence, the first word following the colon should remain lowercase (unless that word is a proper noun).
**Example:** We use three metrics in our reviews: quality, cost, and speed.

## Commas

### Clauses<br>
If two independent clauses are separated by a coordinating conjunction, use a comma unless both clauses are very short.
**Long:** We built everything slowly over the course of several months, and it all seems to work so far.
**Short:** We worked too quickly and it all fell apart.

If a dependent clause and an independent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, don't use a comma unless the sentence would be unclear without it.
**Clear:** The vacuum of space is cold and will kill you almost instantly. 
**Needs comma:** Vacuums are unforgiving in space, but clean carpets marvelously well.

### Introductory phrases<br>
Use a comma after introductory phrases (like *however* or *furthermore* or *on the other hand*).
**Example:** Despite this, we reached the mouth of the cave by sundown.

### Serial commas<br>
Use serial (Oxford) commas.
**No:** I love my parents, Godzilla and Wonder Woman.
**Yes:** I love my parents, Godzilla, and Wonder Woman.

## Dashes

### Em dashes<br>
You can use em dashesâ€”just don't put spaces around them.

## Hyphens

### Compound words<br>
You can use hyphens to eliminate ambiguity for certain compound words (at your discretion).
**Example:** remix
**Example:** re-create
**Example:** prepaid
**Example:** pre-date

But don't pull a New Yorker with excessive or unnecessary hyphen use: no *e-mail* and certainly no *teen-agers*.

### Compound modifiers<br>
Use a hyphen between compound modifiers unless the first word is in adverb ending in *-ly*. 
**Example:** well-learned students
**Example:** easily performed tasks

### Prefixes<br>
Use a hyphen between a prefix and a proper noun or abbreviation.
**Example:** Files with non-JSON syntax are unsupported.

### Suspended hyphens<br>
Use suspended hyphens to list several hyphenated compounds in a row.
**Example:** The craft fair offers soap- and basket-making classes.
**Example:** Bills come in one-, five, and twenty-dollar increments.

## Parentheses

### Mid-sentence parentheticals<br>
Parenthetical statements are useful for mid-sentence examples and short asides (like this one), but excessively long and complicated parentheticals may be better of rewritten as their own sentence (or else you'll end up with a meandering, monstrous behemoth of a sentence that seems to go on and on and on).
