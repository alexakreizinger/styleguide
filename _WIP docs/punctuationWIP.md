## Colons

### Colons and capitalization<br>
If you're using a colon within a self-contained sentence, the first word following the colon should remain lowercase (unless that word is a proper noun).
**Example:** We use three metrics in our reviews: quality, cost, and speed.

## Commas

### Clauses<br>
If two independent clauses are separated by a coordinating conjunction, use a comma unless both clauses are very short.
**Long:** We built everything slowly over the course of several months, and it all seems to work so far.
**Short:** We worked too quickly and it all fell apart.

If a dependent clause and an independent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, don't use a comma unless the sentence would be unclear without it.
**Clear without comma:** The vacuum of space is cold and will kill you almost instantly. 
**Needs comma for clarity:** Vacuums are unforgiving in space, but clean carpets marvelously well.

### Introductory phrases<br>
Use a comma after introductory phrases (like *however* or *furthermore* or *on the other hand*).
**Example:** Despite this, we reached the mouth of the cave by sundown.

### Serial commas<br>
Use serial (Oxford) commas.
**No:** I love my parents, Godzilla and Wonder Woman.
**Yes:** I love my parents, Godzilla, and Wonder Woman.

## Dashes

### Em dashes<br>
You can use em dashesâ€”just don't put spaces between the em dash and the words surrounding it.

## Hyphens

### Compound words<br>
You can use hyphens to eliminate ambiguity for certain compound words (at your discretion). A good rule of thumb is to use a hyphen for compound words that aren't widely used or that could be mistaken for another word.
**Hyphenated:** re-create, pre-date
**Not hyphenated:** remix, prepaid

### Compound modifiers<br>
Use a hyphen between compound modifiers unless the first word is in adverb ending in *-ly*. 
**Hyphenated:** well-learned students
**Not hyphenated:** easily performed tasks

### Prefixes<br>
Use a hyphen between a prefix and a proper noun or abbreviation.
**Example:** Files with non-JSON syntax are unsupported.

### Suspended hyphens<br>
Use suspended hyphens to list several hyphenated compounds in a row.
**Example:** The craft fair offers soap- and basket-making classes.
**Example:** Bills come in one-, five, and twenty-dollar increments.

## Parentheses

### Avoid critical information<br>
Some readers may skip over any text that isn't part of the main sentence, so try not to include any critical information inside parentheses.

### End punctuation<br>
Place end punctuation marks (like commas and periods) outside parentheses unless the punctuation is part of the parenthetical text or the parentheses contain a standalone sentence.
**Outside parentheses:** It's legal to own a zebra in certain states (like Nevada).
**Inside parentheses:** It's legal to own a zebra in certain states. (Nevada is one of them.)

### Mid-sentence parentheticals<br>
Parenthetical statements are useful for mid-sentence examples and short asides (like this one), but excessively long and complicated parentheticals may be better of rewritten as their own sentence (or else you'll end up with a meandering, monstrous behemoth of a sentence that seems to go on and on and on).

## Semicolons

### Avoid overuse<br>
Semicolons are your friend; however, like any friend, you might get sick of them if they show up too frequently. Tread carefully and wisely.

### Clauses<br>
You can use a semicolon to connect two independent clauses.
**Example:** The film received terrible reviews; none of the reviewers could even stay awake through the whole thing.

You can also use a semicolon to connect two independent clauses connected by a conjunctive adverb (like *however* or *similarly*) or, occasionally, a regular old conunction (like *and* or *but* or *if*).
**Example:** Most mountains aren't as tall as Everest; however, they still pose a suitable challenge for climbers.

But consider carefully whether you really need a semicolon or if you'd be better off breaking things into two separate sentences.

### Lists<br>
When commas alone won't suffice, you can use semicolons to separate complex items in a series or list.
**Example:** Our team includes May, a prestigious researcher; Brendan, a tenacious explorer; and Wally, a skilled analyst.
