## Best practices

### Bold UI elements<br>
When writing procedural instructions, if the reader must interact with a specific UI element, put the name of that UI element in bold. 
**Example:** To view additional data in the Explore section, select **Configure**. 

### Capitalize UI elements<br>
Mirror the capitalization of UI elements' names as they appear in the actual product. However, if name of a UI element is inconsistently capitalized within the product or appears in all caps, use sentence case instead.

### Ellipses<br>
If a UI element's name includes an ellipsis, don't include the ellpsis in your description of that element.
**No:** Select **Next...** to proceed.
**Yes:** Select **Next** to proceed.

### Task-oriented instructions<br>
Sometimes it's helpful to describe the task the reader should aim to accomplish rather than the specific buttons or steps they need to followâ€”especially if there are multiple ways to perform the same task or if the way you perform it isn't relevant to its outcome.<br>
However, this isn't a fixed rule and often depends on other contextual factors.
**Good:** Select **Save** before continuing.
**Better:** Save your progress before continuing.

### UI elements as verbs
Don't use the names of UI elements as verbs.

## Interacting with UIs

### Angle brackets<br>
You can use angle brackets (in bold) to describe the process of navigating multiple menu items in a row.
**Good:** In the **Filter** menu, select **Distort**, then select **Liquify**.
**Better:** Select **Filter > Distort > Liquify**.

### Generic element names<br>
Try not to include generic element names (like *button* or *icon*) when instructing readers to interact with that element; instead, just use the name of the element.
**Not ideal:** Select the **Install** button.
**Better:** Select **Install.**

### *Select* vs. *click*<br>
When directing readers to interact with a UI element, try to use *select* instead of *click*. The word *click* implies that the reader must be using a mouse; *select* is a broad term that encompasses mouse clicks, touchscreen taps, keyboard shortcuts, and more.

## UI terminology 

* **Screen:** The physical screen of a device, like a computer or smartphone. Do not use *screen* in reference to software UIs; however, *screen* is often mistakenly used in place of *page*.

* **Window:** A self-contained element that you can open and close.

* **Page:** The active area or interface within an application, program, or website.

* **Dialog box:** A small window that appears on top of the main interface. Although most dialog boxes are technically pop-ups, don't refer to them as *pop-ups*.

* **Pane:** A distinct section or area within a larger window or page. Don't use the word *panel* as a substitute.

* **Menu:** A general term for any list of items or options. If applicable, you can specify one of the following menu types:
    * **Drop-down menu:** A collapsible menu that lets you select from a list of items.
    * **Menu bar:** A menu displayed across the top of a page or window.
    * **Navigation menu:** A menu that lets you select destinations (like a hamburger menu that lets you navigate the various pages of a website).

* **Tab:** An element that resembles a physical file tab. The word *tab* may also refer to the area that that tab leads to or the elements that it contains. (For example: "Select the **Details** tab." versus "In the Details tab, you'll find information about...")

* **Text box:** An element that lets you enter text.

* **Checkbox:** An element that lets you select/unselect a single option or select/unselect any combination of options from a list of items. Try not to use the words *check* or *uncheck* to describe interaction with checkboxes; instead, use *select* or *unselect*. 

* **Radio button:** An element that lets you select one option from a list of multiple items.

* **Toggle:** An element that lets you switch a single option between two states (but does not resemble a checkbox). 

* **Expander arrow:** An small arrow or triangle that lets the user expand or collapse a specific UI element.
